Lisa:  "What, Aunt Patty?"

Lisa:  "Well, I wish you wouldn't, because aside from the fact he has the same

       he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the
       prospects of my adult relationships.  So I hope you bear in mind that
       any knock at him is a knock at me, and I'm far too young to defend
       myself against such onslaughts."
